			We prepare all products for pilaf. We cut onions into cubes, carrots - large enough cubes. 
			In a preheated cauldron, lightly fry the onion in vegetable oil. 
			The pilaf that always turns out is step №4 Add the meat, fry until almost done. 
			The pilaf that always turns out is step №5 Fall asleep carrots, fry. Salt, add spices. 
			Wash the rice well, fill it in a cauldron, stir and pour boiling water so that the water covers the rice by 2-2.5 cm. 
			It is better not to add water. If in the process of cooking it turns out that there is not enough water,
			you can easily add it. But if there is a lot of water, rice is guaranteed to be digested.
			Bring to a boil without covering. We try on salt and if necessary we add salt. 
			As soon as it boils, add the whole heads of garlic, peeled from the top peel, and hot pepper pods. 
			Reduce heat to low, cover and leave pilaf for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, check: 
			if the rice is still raw and the water is gone - add a little hot water and cover again. 
			The finished rice should not be too soft. Turn off the heat and let the pilaf stand for 15-20 minutes.
